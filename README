trawls a directory of .clj files for namespace forms, and outputs a graph of
the information from those forms. the graph is in the graphviz dot language,
so you can run dot on it to get a nice svg out.

example:
if you have a checkout of ring in ~/ring/
java clojure.main ring/ ring.dot
dot ring.dot -Tsvg -o ring.svg
